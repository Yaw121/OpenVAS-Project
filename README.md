### Introduction:
In this lab, I will go through the process of setting up a vulnerability management environment in Azure. I look to learn how to configure and utilize OpenVAS, a vulnerability scanner, to identify and assess security vulnerabilities in a Windows virtual machine (VM). Additionally, I will perform uncredentialed scans, and credentialed scans, apply remediations, and verify the effectiveness of the remediation measures.
